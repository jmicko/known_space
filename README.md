# Known Space - Reading Order by Publishing Date

This list follows the Known Space stories in order of publication,allowing for a reading
experience that reflects how the universe developed over time.You may need to jump between
collections (Three Books of Known Space, Neutron Star, etc.) to find each story.

There are some cases where two stories were published in the same month. Typically they
were published in different magazines, so exact publishing dates are difficult or
impossible to determine. In these cases, the in-universe chronological order has been
used to order conflicting stories in the list. However, it ultimately doesn't matter
which one you read first.

The Man-Kzin Wars stories are an anthology series. Each book is a collection of short stories,
most of which are not written by Larry Niven himself. Instead, they are part of a shared
universe written mostly by other authors. Any stories that are a part of that series and
were written by Niven are listed specifically, while the rest of the books are simply listed
and tagged as optional. Niven provided some canonical information to the authors, so the
stories are probably canon enough to be worth reading.
